Fully Functional Cinema Booking Django WebApp
In my final year at UWE, I took on the role of team leader for this group project. This assignment involved steering the path of the product, delegating tasks, and ensuring active communication lines between team members.

The project was a CRUD-based application designed to mimic a real-world client scenario, dealing with a long list of non-specific requirements. These were designed to replicate situations where client needs may initially be unclear or difficult to articulate.

We primarily used Python Django, supplemented with HTML/CSS and minor Javascript for web development, while SQL was used for database construction. As a hands-on leader, I actively participated in the development process. Taking lead on various elements, including taking the lead in ticket ordering process development, structuring databases, and implementing front-end design features, among others.

The project greatly improved my understanding of team dynamics and the importance of playing to individual strengths. Additionally, it provided valuable experience in utilizing GitHub for version control and continuous integration.
